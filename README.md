# frontend-nanodegree-feedreader
P6 for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree

#####Project Overview

This project involves exploring test-driven JavaScript development with a web-based RSS reader. Using Jasmine's behavior-driven development framework, I wrote different "suites" to test the functionality of RSS Feeds, menu visibility, feed entries and new feeds. I also wrote "specs" to ensure each test suite performed what was expected of it.

This project was completed by writing behavior-driven JavaScript tests using Jasmine.
